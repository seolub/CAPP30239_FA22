## Data Description, interest and potential data points

The data contains different health, educacional and socioeconomic metrics by community area in Chicago. The project will consist of visualize the difference between community areas in metrics such as teen birth rate, income, educational attainment, life expectancy, households below poverty levels and other metrics that are gathered in the file Final_data.csv. 

We will then be able to have an 'Inequality Map'. This visualization will show how Chicago's inequality by neighborhoodes goes further than just income per capita.

## Concerns

Most of the data was gathered between 2009 and 2013. This means that the 'Inequality Map' will be a representation of a past Chicago, and not the current Chicago.
