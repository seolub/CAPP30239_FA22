      As the divide between the haves and have-nots continues to grow, social inequality has become a major issue in society today. From income gaps to disparities in access to education, social inequality has been proven to have a significant impact on both individuals and communities. Inequality is pervasive and can be found in all levels of society, from the local to the global. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Inequality is a major problem in Chicago. The city consistently ranks among the most unequal cities in the country, and the gap between rich and poor is growing. There is a stark divide between wealthy and poor neighborhoods, and the differences in educational, economic, and health outcomes between the two is substantial. Low-income communities are disproportionately impacted by poverty, violence, and other social issues, while wealthy neighborhoods are often insulated from many of these same issues. This inequality has been exacerbated by gentrification, which has pushed long-time residents out of their homes and communities, making it harder for them to access the resources they need to succeed.

    <h4>Income Inequality in Chicago</h4>
    <p>
      Income per capita inequality in Chicago is a major issue for the city. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median household income for the Chicago metropolitan area is $61,382, with a wide range of incomes across neighborhoods. In some of the wealthiest communities in Chicago, such as the Gold Coast, the median income can be upwards of $100,000. In contrast, some of the poorest neighborhoods in the city have a median income of less than $20,000. This stark income disparity contributes to a growing income gap between the rich and the poor in the city, with a large concentration of poverty occurring in the South and West side neighborhoods.

      The map on the right allows to explore differences in income per capita by community areas. The data provided for all the metrics that this article shows are from the City of Chicago Portal. Most of the most recent data is from 2009 and 2010, so metrics will likely be outdated but differences between neighboorhods might overall prevail.

    </p>Income inequality is further compounded by the lack of access to resources and opportunities, creating a cycle of poverty.</p>

      On the right, we can find the community areas that we plotted in the visualization of Chicago. The color from the map remains the same, 
      which means that areas plotted in darker blues are wealthier, while areas plotted in lighter blues are poorer. 
    <p>
      We can see how for unemployment,
      Homicide Rate, Teen Births, Percentage of adults without highschool diploma and percentage of households crowded, we see all the wealthier areas on the left,
      while we find poorer areas on the left of the visualizations. If all these metrics were not correlated with income per capita we would see lighter and darker dots equally spread over the axis. 
    <p>
      Poorer areas tend to have much higher rates of unemployment, homicide rates, teen births, adults without high school diploma and crowded households. 
    </p>
      These five visualizations provide metrics where richer community areas on the left. In the next section we see how 
      Income Per Capita is assocaited with other metrics where richer community areas are on the right.
