            The following graph shows by state how many of the people killed by police are
            African Americans. We can see how they are disproportionally killed by police in many states,
            particularly when we compare the percentage of the population they represent. Absolute number of total killings are provided, 
            as rates provided might not be representative for states with fewer killings.
