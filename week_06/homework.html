        <h3>Police Killings by Ethnicity</h3>
        <p>
            African-Americans represent 12.1% of the US population while White people account for 57.8%.
        </p>
        <div id="chart_1_2"></div>

        <p>
            However, the data shows that African-Americans are killed at a higher rate than other ethnicities. On the other hand, White people are killed at a lower rate than would be expected if ethnicity played no role in police killings.

        <h3>Percentage of African Americans killed out of total killed</h3>
        <p>
            The following graph shows by state how many of the people killed by police are
            African Americans. We can see how they are disproportionally killed by police in many states,
            particularly when we compare the percentage of the population they represent.<br>
            Absolute number of total killings are provided, as rates provided might not be representative for states with fewer killings.

        <h3>How White and African-Americans are killed</h3>
        <p>
            We see some differences between races in terms of how people are killed. For example it looks like white people tend to have a higher number of tasered and shot than
            African Americans people, which could indicate that black people are shot directly without other interventions first.
